        <p class="test" id="standard_text">Kligman made the discovery while working as a seasonal paleontologist at Petrified Forest National Park in 2019. The two fossil lower jaws of Kataigidodon were found in the Upper Triassic Chinle Formation. Because only the lower jaws were discovered and are quite small—half an inch, the size of a medium grain of rice—Kligman only has a semi-picture of how the creature looked, roughly 3.5 inches in total body size, minus the tail.</p>

        <p>The name Kataigidodon venetus derives from the Greek words for thunderstorm, "kataigidos," and tooth, "odon," and the Latin word for blue, "venetus," all referring to the discovery location of Thunderstorm Ridge, and the blue color of the rocks at this site. Kligman didn't name the creature, though. That task fell to Hans Dieter-Sues, coauthor and curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Smithsonian National Museum.</p>
        <p>Additional collaborators include Adam Marsh, park paleontologist at Petrified Forest National Park, who found the jaw fossils with Kligman, and Christian Sidor, an associate professor at the University of Washington's Department of Biology. The research was funded by the Petrified Forest Museum Association, the Friends of Petrified Forest National Park, and the Virginia Tech Department of Geosciences.</p>
